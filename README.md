# DEFCON30 Crash and Compile Contest

[Crash and Compile Website](https://crashandcompile.org/)

## Round One

Had no clue what was going on. Everyone was screaming and going crazy. People drinking
large amounts of alcohol and acting crazy. We had three people trying to help but only
one person was really fluent in Python. Another person was expert level in C++ but we
were getting caught up on syntax and small mistakes. Wasted at least five minutes trying
to figure out that `python` was actually calling the old version 2, whcih I didn't even
know was still installed on my machine? Only one laptop for the whole team... just a 
wild environment to try to work in. 

I think the solution did work. The [output](round1/output.txt) file here shows the same
output that is expected in the exmaple solution. The problem was I didn't realize I
needed to submit before the clock ran out. Also realized I needed to add the `N` back
to the string holding the node name. (That bit was completed after the clock ran out and
everyone was doing shots and running off to vomit)

So... zero points for round one!
